# ðŸŸ¡ Area of Circle in Python

This project is a simple Python program to calculate the *area of a circle* when the radius is given.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Formula Used
The area of a circle is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \pi \times r^2
\]

Where:
- \( r \) = radius of the circle  
- \( \pi \) â‰ˆ 3.14159 (available in Python as math.pi)
