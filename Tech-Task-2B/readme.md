## 📌 Project Overview
This is my little project for **Persona Club recruitment tasks**.  
The objective is to build a simple, clean, and responsive **Event Registration Page** using **HTML & CSS**.  

It demonstrates:

## 🛠️ Made With
- **HTML5** – structure of the page  
- **CSS3** – styling and layout

## 📂 Files
- `index.html` → Main HTML file containing structure of the event registration page.  
- `style.css` → External stylesheet that controls the design (colors, spacing, fonts, etc.).  
- `.png` & `.jpg` files for logo, icon.
